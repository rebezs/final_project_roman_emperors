## Background,

The Roman Emperors ruled the Roman Empire from 27 BC till 395 AC.

## EDA

The emperors rose to and fall out of power by many reasons, so I investigate the causes how they followed each other.

## Probabilities of dying by force, battle, or natural causes

The emperors have died by many reasons. So I fit predictive models for each death type (forced, battle, natural). Since I have no prior hypothesis which predictive variable might be good for the models, I enter all the variables and then leave in the fitted models the ones, which makes the best fitted model.

``` {r}
#null model for modeling the predictors of dying by force
model_forced_null <- glm(died_by_force ~ 1, data = emperors_principate, family = binomial)
summary(model_forced_null)
#MODEL3
model_forced <- glm(died_by_force ~ rise_recoded + century + age_reign_start + reign_long_year, data = emperors_principate, family = binomial, control=glm.control(maxit=50))
summary(model_forced)

tab_model(model_forced_null, model_forced, show.est = TRUE, show.fstat = TRUE, show.aic = TRUE, show.loglik = TRUE)

#null model for modeling the predictors of dying in battle
model_battle_null <- glm(died_by_battle ~ 1, data = emperors_principate, family = binomial)
summary(model_battle_null)
#MODEL4
model_battle <- glm(died_by_battle ~ rise_recoded + age_reign_start, data = emperors_principate, family = binomial, control=glm.control(maxit=50))
summary(model_battle)

tab_model(model_battle_null, model_battle, show.est = TRUE, show.fstat = TRUE, show.aic = TRUE, show.loglik = TRUE)

#null model for modeling the predictors of dying naturally
model_natural_null <- glm(died_naturally ~ 1, data = emperors_principate, family = binomial)
summary(model_natural_null)
#MODEL5
model_natural <- glm(died_naturally ~ rise_recoded + age_reign_start, data = emperors_principate, family = binomial, control=glm.control(maxit=50))
summary(model_natural)

tab_model(model_natural_null, model_natural, show.est = TRUE, show.fstat = TRUE, show.aic = TRUE, show.loglik = TRUE)
```

The AIC number of the fitted models was only higher in the case of the predictive model of dying naturally (fitted model: 52.224, null model: 55.413). This means that the variance in the case of dying in battle or by force cannot be explained by the variables in the dataset, so I will continue to work on the model related to dying naturally.

```{r}
#creating a tibble with the predicted and observed values and the predictive variables
natural_prob <- predict(model_natural, data = emperors_principate, type = "response")
natural_odds <- natural_prob / (1 - natural_prob)
tibble(name = emperors_principate$name, rise = emperors_principate$rise_recoded, age_reign_start = emperors_principate$age_reign_start, probability = natural_prob, odds = natural_odds, observed = emperors_principate$died_naturally)

#creating a classification table to check the predictions
classDF <- data.frame(response = emperors_principate$died_naturally, predicted = round(fitted(model_natural),0))
class_table <- xtabs(~ predicted + response, data = classDF)
# checking the sensitivity of the model
sensitivity <- class_table[2,2] / (class_table[2,1] + class_table[2,2])
cat("The sensitivity of the model: ", sensitivity)
#checking the specificity of the model
specificity <- class_table[1,1] / (class_table[1,2] + class_table[1,1])
cat("The specificity of the model: ", specificity)

#checking the model with 
res <- chisq.test(emperors_principate$died_naturally, round(fitted(model_natural),0))
res
```

## Results

### The age of the emperors at the end of their reign

A multiple logistic regression was calculated to predict the age of the emperors at the end of their reign (age_reign_end).
In MODEL1 rise_recoded and the century was entered as predictive variables.
MODEL1 was significant (F(3, 40) = 69.64, p < 0.05, R^2 = 0.21, RSE = 15.56, RMSE =). The emperor's predicted age_reign_end is equal to 71.561 -15.764 (rise_recoded) - 5.842 (century), where rise_recoded is coded as Birthright and Other and century is counted in centuries. Both predictors were significant.
In MODEL2 rise_recoded and age_reign_start was entered as predictive variables.
MODEL2 was significant (F(2, 41) = 105.8, p < 0.001, R^2 = 0.83, RSE = 7.06). The emperor's predicted age_reign_end is equal to -1.96206 + 13.40431 (rise_recoded) + 1.08973 (age_reign_start), where rise_recoded is coded as Birthright and Other and age_reign_start is counted in years. Both predictors were significant and were homoscedastic (MODEL1: X2(1, N = 44) = 0.6673762, p > 0.05, MODEL2: X2(1, N = 44) = 1.182378, p > 0.05)
The R^2 is higher and RSE is smaller for MODEL2, which means MODEL2 explains higher variability (83% instead of 21%) of the dependent variable.  According to the visualizations as well, MODEL2 is a better fit to the dataset.

### The death of the emperors
A multiple logistic regression was calculated to predict died_naturally (MODEL5), died_by_force (MODEL3), died_by_battle (MODEL4). The AIC numbers of MODEL3 and MODEL4 were higher then their null models, which means these variables cannot be explained by the variables in the dataset.
The prediction of died_naturally was based on rise_recoded and age_reign_start. The emperor's predicted died_naturally is equal to -5.24133 + 2.42209 (rise_recoded)  + 0.07210 (age_reign_start), where rise_recoded is coded as Birthright and Other and age_reign_start is measured in years. Both predictors were significant.
Based on statistical diagnostics the fitted model cannot be considered reliable. Tjur's R2 is 0.15 so the model does not explain the 85% of the variation,  and the predicted and the observed results was found to be independent (X2(1, N = 44) = 7.2196, p < 0.05).
